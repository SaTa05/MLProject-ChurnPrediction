# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry.  
It covers the full ML lifecycle including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Identify customers likely to churn  
- Understand key factors influencing churn  
- Enable proactive customer retention strategies  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Flask  
- Pickle  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed churn distribution  
- Studied relationship between tenure and churn  
- Analyzed impact of contract type and monthly charges  
- Generated correlation heatmaps  

---

## 🤖 Model Development
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Train-Test split  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall
